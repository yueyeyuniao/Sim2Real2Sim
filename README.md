# Sim2Real2Sim: Bridging the Gap Between Simulation and Real-World in Flexible Object Manipulation


### 1. System requirement and installation

Ubuntu 16.04 + [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu)
[Kinova Jaco v2](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/kinova-ros)
[Openrave](https://github.com/yueyeyuniao/openrave)

### 2. Steps to run the task in simulation

(1)launch the Jaco robot and the world in gazebo (should put the 'launch' and 'world' folders under 'kinova_gazebo' folder)
roslaunch kinova_gazebo robot_launch_with_cable_kinect.launch kinova_robot_type:=j2n6s300
(2)launch moveit and use moveit to move the robot to the home position
roslaunch j2n6s300_moveit_config j2n6s300_gazebo_demo.launch
(3)run velocity controller node (should put the research folder in your catkin workspace)
rosrun research_s2r kinova_cart_vel
(4)run modeling
rosrun research_s2r modeling_sim
(5)run task
rosrun research_s2r task_sim

### 3. Transfer the methods from simulation to real-world
The science from simulation to real-world are mostly the same.
The differences would be:
(1)The PID parameters need to be tuned a bit. 
(2)The socket (target) pose detection is added in the real world.
(3)[Yolo](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/wiki/YOLO:-Real-Time-Object-Detection) plus color detection is used in the real world for cable detection which helps with modeling.
(4)Gripper is modified in the real world to reach a better grasp of the cable, while in the simulation, a [link attacher](https://github.com/pal-robotics/gazebo_ros_link_attacher) is used instead.

### 4. Update the simulation model by using the real-world data
(1)Collecting real-world data (joint values) with Apriltags attached on the cable and adding weights to serve as external force
(2)Identifying joint stiffness and damping parameters, and these parameters can be used in the simulation
Openrave is used to help with modeling and calculation. The Openrave model is under ‘openrave_model’ folder. The source code for identifying joint stiffness and damping parameters is located at ‘research_r2s’ folder.
